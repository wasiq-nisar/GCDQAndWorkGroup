/// Global queues are concurrent queues provided by the system that allow multiple tasks to be executed in parallel. When you dispatch a task to a global queue, you can choose whether to dispatch it synchronously or asynchronously:

    }
}

print("Main Thread Block Time: \(CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent() - startTime)")

// Both the tasks ðŸ¥³ and ðŸ˜ˆ are executed concurrently as global is a concurrent queue and the task submitted to them are async
